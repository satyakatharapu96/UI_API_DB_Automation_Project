1. what is selenium
----------------------
Selenium is a open-source automation tool to automate the  web browsers

//Features of selenium
-->it supports different programming languages
--->it supports cross-browser testing(Chrome,FireFox,edge)
--->it supports cross- platform testing(windows,Mac,Linux)
---> it supports parallel testing  via tools like TestNG
note:parallel testing means executing the  multiple test cases  at the same time
it saves time
---->Can be integrated with CI/CD tools like Jenkins.

components in selenium
--------------------------
1.Selenium WebDriver--- selenium webdriver is an interface, it automate browser actions like clicking,navigating,typing
---> it directly interact with browsers using it's native support

2.Selenium IDE---- it is a chrome/firefox extension, it is used for play and record tool for beginners
note:Records user actions as you perform them on a web app.
Creates test scripts automatically 

3.Selenium Grid---- parallel execution
note:parallel execution--->
Allows you to run the same test on different machines and different browsers at the same time.
Speeds up test execution.
real time use----->Used in CI/CD pipelines where the same tests need to be run across Chrome, Firefox, and Edge simultaneously.

4.selenium RC---replaced by WebDriver
Allowed execution of test scripts in multiple browsers.
it is deprecated because it's slow and less efficient then  WebDriver


WebDriver Architecture
----------------------
WebDriver Architecture is a client-server model,it has four components
1.Selenium Client Library---
this is the language binding library, we use to write the code(java)
2.Selenium JSON protocol--- it communicates with client code and browsers.
This protocol helps convert our code into a format the browser understands, using HTTP requests.
3.Browsers--->The driver receives commands from Selenium and forwards them to the actual browser.
4.real browsers--->These are the actual browsers where the tests run. The driver controls them using native automation APIs.
so overall,
when we run a script, Selenium WebDriver sends commands via the JSON Wire Protocol to the browser driver, which then interacts with the real browser."

Flow (in simple words):
--------------------------------
I write Selenium code in Java using the WebDriver API.
This code sends requests (as JSON) to the browser driver.
The driver talks to the browser using native browser APIs.
The browser performs the action and sends a response back.

Locators in selenium
-----------------------
Locators are used to find and interact with WebElements on a web page
